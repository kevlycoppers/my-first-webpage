# My First Webpage

#### The first web page we created together, May 23rd, 2016

#### By Levi Hopkins, Noah Kineky, and Wolfgang Warneke

## Description

Our first webpage we created together in HTML5. It talks about the upcoming things we will learn at Epicodus and has an awesome pic of a pug puppy. There are links to the Epicodus website and to some girls favorite things.

There's some super dank CSS which has a sweet design aesthetic that brings you straight back to 1998.  Yeah.
